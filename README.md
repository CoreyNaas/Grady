# Grady: Grade calculator and manager

Features:
Output GPA based on current grades
Output grade needed on remaining assignments to get a chosen grade in a class
Load and save grade data to a file, grades.txt

Known Bugs:
All data fields must be filled in at file save in order to load from file correctly;
Class names must not contain spaces;
Saving to file overwrites old file completely; saving with no data entered produces an empty grades.txt;
